# IBM-Stock-Data






## Prerequisites

You will require `Jupyter Notebook` to run this code. We recommend that you install 
the latest [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your 
operating system. Anaconda Python distributions include Jupyter Notebook.

Although many options are possible, the 
author highly recommend that users install the appropriate Anaconda package 
for their operating system. In order to ensure that you have all the required 
dependencies, we recommend that you build a suitable Python environment, as 
discussed below.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The analysis will be implemented using Python code that can be found in this Jupyter Notebook. Although highly recommended, the exercise 
does not require any Python programming skills and can be followed by any participant. You will not be asked to write any code but to follow the methodology and understand the processing steps. If you are new to Python or Jupyter Notebooks, here are some references that may help you:
