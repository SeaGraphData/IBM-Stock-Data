# IBM-Stock-Data


Determining the price of a stock is complex; It depends on many things like revenue, profits, losses. company news. public perception, future business, and much more. An essential factor is the company's growth of profit/revenue. If the company reports good profits/revenue, the stock price should increase and if it reports bad profits/revenues the stock price will decrease.

Tesla and GameStop have become very popular stocks, with GameStop being one of the fastest rising and popular stocks of the year. Both have seen tremendous gains and for different reasons. In the course project, we will extract revenue and stock price data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue. This dashboard will not only provide information about the revenue and stock price but will allow us to see if there is a correlation between the two.



## Prerequisites

You will require `Jupyter Notebook` to run this code. We recommend that you install 
the latest [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your 
operating system. Anaconda Python distributions include Jupyter Notebook.

Although many options are possible, the 
author highly recommend that users install the appropriate Anaconda package 
for their operating system. In order to ensure that you have all the required 
dependencies, we recommend that you build a suitable Python environment, as 
discussed below.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The analysis will be implemented using Python code that can be found in this Jupyter Notebook. Although highly recommended, the exercise 
does not require any Python programming skills and can be followed by any participant. You will not be asked to write any code but to follow the methodology and understand the processing steps. If you are new to Python or Jupyter Notebooks, here are some references that may help you:
